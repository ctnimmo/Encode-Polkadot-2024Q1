# Encode-Polkadot-2024Q1
Code for Encode Club Polkadot Hackathon/Project Feb-Mar 2024

Initial idea: create a "nursery" to spin up and test chain features of substrate/Polkadot.

## Content
- inkathon-front-end: boilerplate (to be customised) from https://github.com/scio-labs/use-inkathon
- substrate-front-end: template (to be customised) from https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template
- subtrate-node: template (to be customised) https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template
- subtrate-node-2: same as substrate-node (but to be customised differently)

*NOTE: main/master branch code has been used as the basis for the templates/boilerplates and .git folders have been removed to separate them from their origin* 

## Setup:

The current setup is based on the setup (build and run) provided by the README on Substrate Developer Hub's github projects (https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub):


As the project progresses (and diverges from the templates) then the instructions regarding setup and configuration will be updated.
