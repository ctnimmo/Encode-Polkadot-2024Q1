# Encode-Polkadot-2024Q1
Code for Encode Club Polkadot Hackathon/Project Feb-Mar 2024

Initial idea: create a "nursery" to spin up and test chain features of substrate/Polkadot.

## Setup:

The current setup is based on the setup (build and run) provided by the README on Substrate Developer Hub's github projects (https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub):
Subtrate node template: https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template
Substrate front end template: https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template

As the project progresses (and diverges from the templates) then the instructions regarding setup and configuration will be updated.
